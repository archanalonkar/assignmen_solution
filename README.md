# assignmen_solution


## Workflows

### 1. Update config.yaml
- Modify the configuration file as per your project requirements. This may include settings for paths, parameters, and other configurations needed for the project.

### 2. Update schema.yaml
- Make necessary changes to the schema file, which defines the structure of your dataset, column types, and other data-related configurations.

### 3. Update params.yaml
- Adjust the parameters in this file to fit your projectâ€™s requirements. This could include hyperparameters for training models, evaluation metrics, and other related settings.

### 4. Update the entity
- Modify any entities in the project based on the needs of your pipeline (e.g., features, target variables, or additional attributes in your dataset).

### 5. Update the configuration manager in `src/config`
- Make changes to the configuration manager to ensure proper integration with the updated files (e.g., loading configurations from YAML files).

### 6. Update the components
- Ensure that the components of the project (data validation, data preprocessing, feature engineering, etc.) are updated to work with the latest version of your configuration and schema.

### 7. Update the pipeline
- Adjust the pipeline to ensure it reflects any changes made in the configuration, schema, or components. This will ensure the correct flow of data through the various stages.

### 8. Update `main.py`
- Make necessary adjustments to the `main.py` script that controls the execution of your machine learning pipeline. This may include importing components and running the pipeline steps.

### 9. Update `app.py`
- Modify the Flask app (`app.py`) to handle user input, run predictions, and return results as needed. Ensure all routes and logic are working as expected.
